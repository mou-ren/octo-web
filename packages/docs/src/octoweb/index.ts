 * `const { data } = await apiClient().get<T>(path)`, and the test mock (octoweb/mock.ts)
 * returns `{ data, status }`. Against the un-wrapped host client `data` is `undefined`, so
 * e.g. DocsHome's `res.items` throws "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'items')"
 * — breaking EVERY docs API call in production while all tests stay green.
 *
 * Fixing it here, at the single seam, re-establishes one contract for all ~20 call sites
 * instead of touching each one: the host method resolves to the body, we re-wrap it into
 * `{ data: <body>, status }`. Config (incl. the host's `config.param` → axios params) is
 * forwarded untouched, so the host signature keeps working.
 *
 * The ERROR path needs the same adaptation. The host rejects with `APIClientRejectedError`
 * (`{ error, msg, status, code, … }` — see dmworkbase/Service/APIClient.ts), NOT an axios-style
 * `{ response }`. But every docs error handler reads `err.response?.status` / `err.response.data?.error`
 * (members 404 → user_not_found, attachments 400, versions 409, delete status classification …).
 * Against the un-adapted host rejection `err.response` is `undefined`, so EVERY production error
 * branch silently falls through to its default while all tests (which inject the axios-style mock)
 * stay green. We re-wrap the rejection too, lifting the original axios error's `{ status, data }`
 * up to `.response`, so the same `{ response }` contract holds on both the success and error paths.
